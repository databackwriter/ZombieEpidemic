##Zombie Apocalypse in R

###Understanding
This is a study of epidemiology. The basis of the study is to model the interactions between zombies and humans (aka susceptibles). The interatction between can be modelled mathematically by the below differential equation[^1]:
S0 =  ô€€€ SZ ô€€€ S
Z0 = SZ + R ô€€€ SZ
R0 = S + SZ ô€€€ R:

####Definitions
- Humanoid: a human or a zombie

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
